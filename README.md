# Meme-Generator
This project is a meme generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with the Imgflip API to fetch meme templates. Users can select a template, add top and bottom text, and generate a preview. The meme can then be downloaded as an image, styled with a user-friendly interface.
